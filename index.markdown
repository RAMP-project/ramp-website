### **Welcome to the RAMP project webpage!**

RAMP is an [open-source software suite](https://github.com/RAMP-project)  for the stochastic simulation of any user-driven energy demand time series based on few simple inputs. 

The project aims to provide synthetic data wherever metered data does not exist, such as when designing systems in remote areas or when looking at future electric-vehicle fleets. Check out the [documentation](https://rampdemand.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) and all our [applications](/applications)!

### **The RAMP team**

Born as a small side project, RAMP is now a multi-institution software development effort. We are working to make RAMP even more user-friendly and internally reliable. You can learn more on RAMP's [development history](/about) and the ongoing ['next-gen' co-development process](/development) on this website.
