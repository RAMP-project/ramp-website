The RAMP project is currently contributed and co-funded by several people. We acknowledge the main contributors to the latest version of the software in the recent publication in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06418). 

Of course, many more people have contributed to RAMP throughout its evolution. We acknowledge all code contributors on [GitHub](https://github.com/RAMP-project), while other collaborators who did not necessarily contribute to the code are featured in the scientific publications. You can get an overview of RAMP's history below.

<h style="color: ;"><b>Mid 2018.</b> There is no open-source software to simulate energy demand time series based on partial and uncertain data. We decide to address this gap in a small team of three institutions. The RAMP project is born.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Jun 2019.</b> RAMP is validated against real-world data, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.097">peer-reviewed</a> and released openly on GitHub.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Feb 2020.</b> RAMP starts walking on its own legs. Many institutions use it for their own studies.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Jul 2020.</b> As per the original plan, RAMP branches out to other energy carriers. Some of the original developers use it to simulate <a href="https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/e0c31c0f-a7b8-4599-e053-1705fe0aef77/ECOS2020-lombardi_quoilin_colombo-flexibility%20of%20smart%20p2h%20vpps.pdf">domestic hot water demand</a> time series in Italy</h></p>

<br>
<h style="color: ;"><b>Feb 2021.</b> The multi-carrier vocation of the tool grows. RAMP is used to simulate cooking energy demand time series across Europe in the context of <a href="https://sentinel.energy/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/D4.2-EC.pdf">EU-funded projects</a>.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Oct 2021.</b> It is about time for an application to passenger mobility time series. The standalone <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP-mobility">RAMP-mobility application</a> to simulate mobility and charging time series of electric vehicles across Europe is made publicly available. </h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Feb 2022.</b> The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118676">peer-reviewed publication of RAMP-mobility</a>, including its validation, is finally out. New institutions start using both RAMP and RAMP-mobility </h></p> 
<br>

<p><h style="color: ;"><b>Jun 2022.</b></h> TU Delft, the Reiner Lemoine Institut, the VITO Research Center and the University of Li√®ge join forces to co-fund the development of a <a href="/development">'next-gen' version of RAMP</a>. More user-friendly and efficient, installable via pip and more extensively documented. </p> 
<br>

<p><h style="color: ;"><b>Feb 2023.</b></h> The first nex-gen version of RAMP is released as <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP/tree/v0.4.0">v0.4.0</a>! See the <a href="/development">development</a> page to discover all the new features. Next step: connect RAMP-mobility to this line of development, making it a plug-and-play application of the base RAMP software. Stay tuned! </p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Jun 2023.</b></h> New institutions reuse RAMP and RAMP-mobility, develop interfaces for use with the public or industry and join our <a href="/development">development</a> process. More publications based on RAMP pop up around the world. </p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Jun 2024.</b></h> RAMP's code is peer-reviewed, published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06418">Journal of Open Source Software</a>, and released in a new, further enhanced version. This formalises RAMP as a co-development project contributed by many people and institutions. </p>
