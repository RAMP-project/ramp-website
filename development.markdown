The RAMP project is currently undergoing extensive further development, jointly led by TU Delft, the Reiner Lemoine Institut, VITO, the University of Li√®ge, and the Leibniz University Hannover. 

These joint developments have been recently formalised in RAMP's publication in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06418), alongside a **brand new version** of the tool: more extensively documented, richer in visualisation options, and more easy to customise for different [applications](/applications)! We aim to keep improving and expanding the tool, leveraging the diverse expertise of our multi-institution team.

<br>
<br>
<p>Already done and available as a new <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP/tree/v0.5.2">v0.5.2 release</a> of the code:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>inputs can be defined in tabular (.xslx) format</li>
  <li>outputs can be easily post-processed and plotted</li>
  <li>the code is a Python package installable via pip</li>
  <li>the documentation is expanded and released on readthedocs</li>
  <li>parallel processing is possible</li>
  <li>code is faster thanks to vectorising operations</li>
  <li>a new UseCase class allows grouping multiple Users and performing operations on those</li>
  <li>web-based graphical user interface for basic functionalities</li>
  <li>random-seed functionality to ensure reproducible results if needed</li>
  <li>more examples as Jupyter notebooks in the documentation</li>
  <li>new features to model productive uses, such as continuously operating machines </li>
  <li>expanded internal test coverage for higher code reliablity</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Work-in-progress:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>bringing back together RAMP-mobility as a customisation option that builds on the same stochastic 'engine'</li>
  <li>further developing the 'heat' features</li>
  <li>application and possible new functionalities for non-energy loads, such as water demand</li>
</ul></p>
