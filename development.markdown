The RAMP project is currently undergoing extensive further development, jointly led by TU Delft, the Reiner Lemoine Institut, the VITO Research, the University of Liège and Sympheny. 

We have recently released a **'next-gen' version** of the tool: more user-friendly, installable via pip, more easy to customise for different [applications](/applications)! We aim to keep improving and expanding the tool, leveraging the diverse expertise of our multi-institution team.

<br>
<br>
<p>Already done and available as a new <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP/tree/v0.4.0">v0.4.0 release</a> of the code:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>inputs can be defined in an Excel spreadsheet</li>
  <li>input parameters are better defined and described in the code</li>
  <li>profiles can be generated for a whole year with monthly seasonality</li>
  <li>it is possible to provide a date range (start, end) to generate a profile within it</li>
  <li>outputs can be automatically resampled to hourly resolution</li>
  <li>the code is a Python package installable via pip</li>
  <li>the documentation is expanded and released on readthedocs</li>
  <li>parallel processing is possible</li>
  <li>code is faster thanks to vectorising operations</li>
  <li>new features can be automatically tested against benchmark results</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Work-in-progress:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>bringing back together RAMP-mobility as a customisation option that builds on the same stochastic 'engine'</li>
  <li>developing a web-based API</li>
</ul></p>
